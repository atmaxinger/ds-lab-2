Reflect about your solution!


Status: I have implemented all commands on the server and on the client.
According to my tests (automatic and manual) both parts work correctly.


Summary:
- After I implemented all commands and I began testing them, I found a lot of errors, primarily in the interaction between the single commands. Maybe these type of errors could be prevented by writing the testcases before the actual implementation.


- The most difficult part for me was to detect whether the server has public message or a response of a previously sent command. Now I use a prefix to detect what kind of message was sent and notify the blocking command if a response has arrived.


- I used git to help me to keep the overview of my program.


- I began to implement my program about three weeks before the deadline. After about 3 days I have implemented all commands. The rest of the time I used to test and fix bugs.


- This was the first time of me that I've used threads, synchronisation and sockets in java extensively.
